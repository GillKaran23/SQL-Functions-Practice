# SQL Function Practice

This repository contains SQL practice exercises designed to learn and master different SQL functions, including string functions, numeric functions, and date and time functions. The exercises are based on a sample **employee_data** table that can use to run queries and validate results.

## Table Structure

### **employee_data** Table

| last_name   | VARCHAR(50)   | Last name of the employee.       |
| salary      | DECIMAL(10,2) | Employee's salary.               |
| hire_date   | DATE          | The date the employee was hired. |
| department  | VARCHAR(50)   | Department in which the employee works. |
